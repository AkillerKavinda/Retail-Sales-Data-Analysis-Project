# Retail Sales Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

> **Note:** This project was built while following a YouTube tutorial to practice and learn Power BI. The goal was to understand the concepts and apply them. Any modifications or experiments I made are my own.

## Overview

Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze retail sales performance across regions, product categories, customer segments, and shipping modes. I use interactive visuals and key metrics to help stakeholders explore trends, compare profitability, and make informed decisions.

## What I Did

- Imported the dataset directly into Power BI.
- Created DAX measures to calculate:
  - Total Sales

  - Average Profit
  - Average Value of Sale
  - Total Customers
- Designed and built the following visuals:
  - KPI summary cards
  - Sales by Region
  - Sales by Product Category and Region
  - Sales by Product Category
  - Sales and Profit by Month
  - Sales and Profit by Country
  - Sales and Profit by Shipping Mode
- Applied slicers for customer segment, return status, and region.
- Structured the dashboard layout to ensure clarity and intuitive navigation.

## Key Insights
